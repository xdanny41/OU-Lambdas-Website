          Lambda Phi Epsilon was founded on February 25, 1981 by a group of
          nineteen dedicated men led by Principal Founder Master Craig Ishigo.
          The goal of the founders was to transcend the limitations faced by
          traditional Asian-interest organizations on campus. While these
          organizations were often split along lines of national origins, the
          founders sought an establishment that drew its membership equally from
          the different segments of the Asian American community. Their vision
          was that the members would eventually become the leaders of their
          respective ethnic communities, and thus, bridge the gaps fragmenting
          the Asian American community through their affiliation with a common
          organization. While the initial charter was comprised of Asian Pacific
          Americans, the brotherhood was open to all who were interested in
          supporting these goals. Establishing Alpha Chapter at UCLA, Mr. Craig
          Ishigo and Mr. Darryl L. Mu signed the charter as President and Vice
          President, respectively.

        <p class="botm-quote">
          On September 8th, 1990, Lambda Phi Epsilon reached another milestone
          and became the first and only nationally recognized Asian-interest
          fraternity in the United States with the admission to the National
          Interfraternity Conference. In 2004, Lambda Phi Epsilon expanded as an
          international fraternity by chartering its first chapter outside of
          the United States at the University of Toronto. In 2006, Lambda Phi
          Epsilon joined the National Asian Pacific Islander Desi American
          Panhellenic Association to increase collaboration and partnership
          between fellow APIDA Greek organizations. Today, Lambda Phi Epsilon is
          widely renowned as the preeminent international Asian-interest
          fraternal organization, providing outstanding leadership,
          philanthropy, and advocacy in the community.

      <p class="botm-quote">
        On February 12, 2006, six men came together to form the Lambda Phi
        Epsilon interest group, the Brotherhood of Asian Men (BAM). After
        venturing to Houston for the southwest regional event, Governor's Cup,
        they decided that Lambda Phi Epsilon was the perfect fit. By the Fall of
        2006, BAM had more than doubled in size bringing its roster to fourteen
        brothers strong. Through their next year and a half venture, the men of
        BAM would travel across the nation, from California to New York, Texas
        to Michigan, meeting brothers of Lambda Phi Epsilon and gaining
        experiences that will be remembered for a lifetime. During this time,
        BAM held numerous philanthropic, brotherhood and social events to help
        the organization grow, bond, and establish recognition of its name.
        Finally on December 2nd, 2007, all fourteen men crossed, thus Lambda Phi
        Epsilon was formally brought to the University of Oklahoma. In all, the
        fourteen were of diverse backgrounds consisting members of Caucasian,
        Chinese, Hmong, Korean, and Vietnamese origins.
      </p>
      <p class="botm-quote">
        Since becoming Lambdas, the Oklahoma Chapter has been successful in
        advancing the Asian Greek scene in both the university and the
        community. With a minimum of four philanthropy projects a semester,
        participation with the intramural sports teams, and hosting various
        social functions for both Asian and Greek organizations, the "OU
        Lambdas" has definitely become leaders in innovation, diversity, and
        unity fit for the Lambda motto and serving the principal goals of the
        founders--"to be leaders among men."

        Lambda Phi Epsilon works with the
        <a href="https://bethematch.org/" style="color: royalblue"
          >National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)</a
        >
        to save the lives of patients requiring bone marrow transplants.
        Additionally, the fraternity promotes awareness for leukemia and other
        blood disorders. Individuals who suffer from these types of illnesses
        depend on donors with similar ethnic backgrounds to find compatible bone
        marrow matches. Thus, the fraternity aims to register as many committed
        donors to the cause through local
        <a href="https://twitter.com/BeTheMatch" style="color: royalblue"
          >#BeTheMatch</a

        campaigns to increase the chances for patients to find a life-saving a
        donor.

      <p class="botm-quote">
        In 1995, Evan Chen, a member of Theta Chapter at Stanford University,
        was diagnosed with leukemia. Their chapter, along with Evan’s friends,
        organized a joint effort to find a bone marrow donor. What resulted was
        the largest bone marrow typing drive in the history of the NMDP and
        Asian American Donor Program (AADP). In a matter of days, over two
        thousand people were typed into the bone marrow registry. A match was
        eventually found for Evan, but unfortunately by that time the disease
        had taken its toll on him and he passed away in 1996. In Evan’s memory,
        the national philanthropy for Lambda Phi Epsilon was established and the
        fraternity has been working with the organization from that point
        forward.
