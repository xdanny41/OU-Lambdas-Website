      <p class="botm-quote">
        Rush is a period of time near the beginning of a semester where students
        can meet members of different Greek organizations and get a glimspse of
        what Greek life is. Usually lasting 1-2 weeks, various events are held
        for potentials to get to know the Active House.
      </p>
      <li><h1 class="mainpage-heading3">Should I attend Rush Events?</h1></li>
      <p class="botm-quote">
        If you are serious about joining Lambda Phi Epsilon, you are highly
        encouraged to attend all rush events from beginning to end. Rush is
        designed to give interested individuals a glimpse into real fraternity
        life, so the more you experience and see for yourself, the better idea
        you will have of whether the fraternity is something you want to be a
        part of. &Alpha;&Phi; Chapter requires at least 2 rush events and one
        informational to be considered for a bid.
      </p>
      <li><h1 class="mainpage-heading3">What happens after Rush?</h1></li>
      <p class="botm-quote">
        If you are interested in joining us, you will be offered an interview.
        After that, if the brothers feel that you are a good fit for the
        fraternity, you will be given an invitation to pledge and become a
        brother of Lambda Phi Epsilon.

        <h1 class="mainpage-heading3">Am I required to join Post-Rush?</h1>
      </li>
      <p class="botm-quote">
        No, there is no obligation for you to take action after rush has
        concluded. Rush is simply an opportunity for you to introduce yourself
        and become more familiar with the fraternity and the brothers.

          How will joining Lambda Phi Epsilon affect my education?
        </h1>
      </li>
      <p class="botm-quote">
        While you are encouraged to learn more about the Greek system, we want
        you to remember why you are at school in the first place. Lambda Phi
        Epsilon’s first and foremost purpose is to promote academic achievement
        and this priority is stressed even to prospective members. Like any
        worthwhile undertaking, joining a fraternity will most likely require
        some time and effort. Managing school and joining a fraternity is
        definitely possible, though, and part of becoming a Lambda is learning
        how to handle these challenges and become a responsible, well-rounded
        individual. The active members of the fraternity are students as well,
        and they will be committed to ensuring your academic success. Be sure to
        find the right balance to have a rewarding college life both
        academically and socially.

        <h1 class="mainpage-heading3">Do I need to be Asian to join?</h1>
      </li>
      <p class="botm-quote">
        No. Lambda Phi Epsilon is an Asian interest fraternity that focuses on
        the promotion of Asian American awareness, but members of every
        ethnicity, race, religion, and creed are accepted.
